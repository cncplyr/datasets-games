Emerging Tectonics, Hot Spring Terraces, A fumarole field containing recently errupted super-heated gas vents indicates an active volcanic chain.
Melted Glacier, Glacial Remnant, This melting remnant of a retrating glacier indicates a rapidly changing landscape.
Sentient Microbial Colony, Microbial Community, "Tendrils filter through the air and ground for nutrients, and relay sensory information to the microbial colony."
Thermal Rise, Fumarole Field, "The rift valley pulls itself apart, opening fissures for hot gases and vapors to be emitted."
